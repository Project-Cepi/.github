## Contributing
Our development server is entirely open source. Feel free to contribute to any of the repositories below and make your stamp on the Cepi tooling!

We use Kotlin as our primary language. New repositories are templated with [ExampleExtension](https://github.com/Project-Cepi/ExampleExtension).

[KStom](https://github.com/Project-Cepi/KStom) is our general kotlin to minestom library,
and [Kepi](https://github.com/Project-Cepi/Kepi) is our inhouse stdlib as a common dependency for all Cepi extensions.
